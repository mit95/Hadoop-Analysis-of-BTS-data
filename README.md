Link: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

Everyday there are millions of flights that fly between different airports in the United States. Many flights are delayed, canceled or diverted. It will be of interest to any airline business/airports to study and analyze the reasons why flights are delayed and how to improve travel services

ANALYSIS PERFORMED:
1) What is the biggest contribution of delays for every airline? (Hadoop Map Reduce Counter)
2) Top 10 most punctual flights? (Hadoop Map Reduce chaining)
3) Busiest airport in USA? (Hadoop Map Reduce Secondary sort by year)
4) Number of canceled flights / carrier? (Hive)
5) Best month for travel with least weather related delays? (Hive)
6) Which airport had the most NAS delays? (Pig)
7) Which carrier had the least number of diverted flights? (mongoDb)

Code for analysis 1 to 3 is present in this repository. For analysis 4 to 7, please check the project report
